# **13.Fix-old-typo**
This was a challenging one, because i got it wrong a few times:(

We can check a log to see that our second last commit is wrong. The file during the commit is also wrong there.

We can change our Head to the state just before making the second commit by using the following command: `git rebase -i HEAD~2`

The -i flag is for interactive mode, it takes us to our editor. 
It shows this 
```
pick d82ccb8 Add Hello wordl
pick cd1f3ba Further work on Hello world
```
We have to write edit instead of pick for the first one . Eg `edit d82ccb8 Add Hello wordl`. Then add the file for staging.

We now have to fix the old typo in file.txt and then use the  command `git rebase --continue`
It will again take us to our editor and show 
```
Add Hello wordl
```
After saving it, we come across a merge conflict.
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hello world
=======
Hello wordl
Hello world is an excellent program.
>>>>>>> cd1f3ba (Further work on Hello world)
```
We just have to save it as and add the file for staging.
```
Hello world
Hello world is an excellent program.
```
Doing `git rebase --continue` and saving the commit as it is, we can verify to see that we have solved the level finally!

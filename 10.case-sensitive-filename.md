# **10.Case-sensitive-filename**

Here we have a file name 'File.txt' we want it to be renamed to 'file.txt'.

We can use our normal command `mv File.txt file.txt` , but then we have to manually stage the file.txt again.

Instead, we can use this command: `git mv File.txt file.txt`. This automatically stages the renamed file and also stages it as 'renamed'.

Just commit and verify now:)

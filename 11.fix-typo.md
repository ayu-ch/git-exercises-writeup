# **11.Fix-typo**

Here we have file.txt which contains the following text:
>Hello wordl

If we check the previous commit using `git log` we can say that it says `Add Hello worcl`.

To fix this , we can change the file's contents to **Hello world**.

Now we can add the file and use the following command to fix the last commit:
```
git commit --amend -m 'Your commit'
```
Now just verify to see that you have completed the level!

Here , we have to simply make it so that the changes in `hot-bugfix` branch are applied at the `change-branch-history` branch and that it will be our HEAD branch.

We have to make sure we are on the **change-branch-history** branch and then execute the following command: `git rebase hot-bugfix`

Do git verify and carry on to the next level.

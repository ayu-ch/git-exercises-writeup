# **4.Ignore-them**
This is a pretty important challenge since this deals with the files we dont want to upload. A lot of times we might not want to upload files which have sensitive information. In that case, we use this.

```
Instructions
It is often good idea to tell Git which files it should track and which it should not.
Developers almost always do not want to include generated files, compiled code or libraries into their project history.

Your task is to create and commit configuration that would ignore:

all files with exe extension
all files with o extension
all files with jar extension
the whole libraries directory
```
Here, we have to create a `.gitignore` file and add the types of file which we want to ignore.(Note: * stands for all)
```
*.exe
*.o
*.jar
libraries/
```
Just add the .gitignore file , commit and verify! You completed the challenge:)

# **Remove-ignored**

We had a `ignored.txt` file tracked before we added that file to .gitignore file. So we have to make it such that changes are not tracked anymore. 

We can use a simple command : `git rm ignored.txt` 

We have to just add, commit and then verify and you have solved the challennge:)
